# Nykaa Beauty Product Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews of Nyaka's beauty products. By employing a classifier and RandomForest algorithm, we aim to extract valuable insights regarding customer satisfaction and preferences towards Nyaka's products.

## Features
- **Classifier:** The project utilizes a classifier to categorize customer reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments based on the language used in the reviews.
- **RandomForest Algorithm:** RandomForest algorithm is employed to train the model for sentiment classification. RandomForest is a powerful ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
- **NLP Techniques:** Various NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization are applied to preprocess the text data before feeding it into the classifier.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
  - matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:** Prepare your dataset containing Nyaka's beauty product reviews. Ensure that the dataset includes a column for the review text and another column for the corresponding sentiment label (positive, neutral, or negative).
2. **Preprocessing:** Preprocess the text data using NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization. You can use libraries like NLTK for this purpose.
3. **Training the Model:** Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets. Train the RandomForest classifier using the training data.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new customer reviews.

## Results
- The trained model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in sentiment classification.
- Analysis of the results provides insights into customer sentiment towards Nyaka's beauty products, helping in understanding customer preferences and areas for improvement.
